Mail server software: Postfix
Operating system: Debian

Configure DNS Records:

    Set up the DNS records for your mail server. This typically involves
    creating an A record for the mail server hostname and a Mail Exchange (MX)
    record that points to the A record.

Set Up Reverse DNS (RDNS/PTR) Record:

    Ensure that your server's IP address has a valid reverse DNS record, as
    many mail servers use this to check for spam.

Firewall Configuration:

    Configure your server's firewall to allow incoming and outgoing traffic on
    the necessary ports for email services (e.g., SMTP, IMAP, POP3).

SSL/TLS Certificate:

    Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate to enable secure connections for email
    clients (SMTPS, POP3S, IMAPS).

Configure Mail Server Software:

    Edit the configuration files for your chosen mail server software. This
    involves setting up basic settings like domain names, mailboxes, and
    aliases.

Authentication and Security:

    Implement authentication mechanisms like SASL (Simple Authentication and
    Security Layer) to secure email delivery and prevent unauthorized access.

Testing and Troubleshooting:

    Test the mail server by sending and receiving emails internally and
    externally. Monitor logs for any issues and troubleshoot as needed.

Additional Features (Optional):

    Depending on your requirements, you can set up additional features like
    spam filtering, antivirus scanning, and DKIM/SPF/DMARC authentication to
    enhance security and email deliverability.
